Extension to forget all your processing Worries

Problem Statement: Many a times in our Os we watch a lot of movies and often read journals magazines, take screenshots of various memes download our study material and save it directly in our system. It leads to a complete chaos to our system and eats up a lot of resources. We often waste a lot of time searching for a particular file in exams because it is inside images and we cannot get a clear view of our file. So the processing and manual task of searching is always there. In the same way we like to watch a youtube lecture or a live meeting without any lags and it often seems impossible to grab each and every word the mentor said. To keep up we watch videos or see shared lengthy files in 2x.

Problem Solution:  We are trying to build a browser extension which is going to be the all In One solution for all your messy data filling up your computer space 
We also face security issues while downloading any file or uploading or saving in a cloud based service. 
Our extension is the key to all. With Advanced analytical and statistical tools we can easily manage our messy data offline. Either summary of a lengthy meeting, image description of a file shared in your meeting , NCERT books downloaded and flooding your system. 


Makes it easy for all kind of Professions and ages. Suppose your exams are one day away and you have all the study material and videos but they are of no use as they are not all in particular sequence and order. They are using your space and yet you cannot find a particular file if images are present.
